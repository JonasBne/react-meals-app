## Description

This is a dummy food order app called 'ReactMeals'. I developed this application to practice React
fundamentals such as props, hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer,...) and state management.

Feel free to share your thoughts.


## Installation

```bash
$ git clone repo 
$ npm install
```

## Running the app

```bash
# compile project
$ npm run build

# development mode
$ npm run start
